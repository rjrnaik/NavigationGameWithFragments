**Navigation Game with Fragments**

- The HomeProject navigation game is a project involving fragments, navigation and Firebase authentication and firestore database integration.
- Use of SafeArgs is also involved to transfer arguments between fragments.
- The Firebase authentication is added to the loginFragment and the user is navigated to next fragment. Already existing user is logged in and new user is registered and added as existing user.
- The FIrestore database is created with name “GameData” and data is stored to database upon image button click event on Statistics page.
- A bonus fragment is also added to display statistics for all user statistics stored in database.
- The application returns Snackbar notifications at all events.
